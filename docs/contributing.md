## Pull Requests
We love pull requests.  Just fork the repo, make your changes, send us a PR, and we'll work it out.

We'd be especially interesting in support for more archive formats (Bzip2 and CPIO are likely targets).

Also, please check out the component libraries in the [Binject group on GitHub](https://github.com/Binject)!  

There are a lot of opportunities to really build out this toolset with support for more injection methods and file types!
